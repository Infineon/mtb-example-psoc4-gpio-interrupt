# PSoC&trade; 4: GPIO interrupt

This code example demonstrates the use of a GPIO configured as an input pin to generate interrupts on PSoC&trade; 4.
The GPIO signal interrupts the CPU and executes a user-defined interrupt service routine (ISR). The GPIO interrupt acts as a wakeup source to wake the CPU from Deep Sleep.

## Hardware setup


This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** PSoC&trade; 4 kits ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following table lists the arguments for this tool:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[GPIO Interrupt](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-gpio-interrupt.git)" application with the desired name "MyGPIOInterrupt" configured for the *CY8CKIT-041S-MAX* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyGPIOInterrupt --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For more details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP and click **Next**.
   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.
   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**
   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.
   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.
   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Connect the kit to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

   From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:

	```
   make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
   ```
   Example:

   ```
   make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-041S-MAX TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
   ```
   After programming, the application starts automatically.

   **Note:**  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

   </details>

3. Observe that the LED blinks four times and then turns OFF, indicating that the CPU has entered Deep Sleep.

4. Press the user button to trigger an interrupt. This should wake up the device, causing the LED to resume blinking at a faster rate (default = 2 Hz). The faster blink rate indicates that the ISR has executed to change the delay variable used to determine the LED blink rate. The LED blinks four times and the device enters Deep Sleep again.

5. Press the button again to repeat the wakeup cycle. The LED resumes blinking at a slower rate (default = 1 Hz). With every interrupt and execution of the ISR, the interval of blinking is alternated between slower and faster rates.

**Note:** The LED states are inverted for the CY8CKIT-149 kit.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

This code example uses a GPIO interrupt to wake the CPU from Deep Sleep. An LED is connected to an output pin; it is used for indicating the current state of the CPU. A blinking LED indicates that the CPU is active. After four successive blinks, the CPU is instructed to enter Deep Sleep. The GPIO state is retained during Deep Sleep, so the LED stops blinking and stays "OFF" to indicate that the CPU is in Deep Sleep.

An input pin, externally connected to a switch, is configured to generate an interrupt when the switch is pressed. The interrupt triggers the following two actions:

1. Generates a signal that wakes the CPU from Deep Sleep.

2. Executes an ISR.

When the ISR is executed, a flag is updated, which is used to change the rate of blinking the LED. With every press of the switch, the LED alternates the blinking interval.
